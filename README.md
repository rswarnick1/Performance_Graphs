# Performance_Graphs
Performance graphs for directed acyclic graph of detections embedded in a taxonommy structure, 
where going deeper in the taxonoy is equivalent to more specificity of the detection.
(detections at high levels in the taxonomy are supersets of the events contained in the lower
leverls)
